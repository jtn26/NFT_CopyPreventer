# NFT_CopyPreventer

There are numerous NFTs being minted today. Many of the major companies, however, lose large amounts of money due to copies of their NFTs that they are unaware of. In light of this problem, we have created a classifier that flags whether or not an NFT is a copy/altered version of an NFT through machine learning and hashing functions.
